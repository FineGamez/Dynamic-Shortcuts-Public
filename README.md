Welcome to the 🚀Dynamic Shortcuts🚀 app!

This app is a simple, easy to use tool for creating shortcuts to:
<ul>
  <li>Folders</li>
  <li>Files <i>(images, videos, etc...)</i></li>
  <li>Apps</li>
  <li>Websites</li>
</ul>

To get it up and running, please download the latest version from our <a href="https://github.com/FineGamez/Dynamic-Shortcuts-Public/releases">releases</a> page.

Place it in a directory of your choice.

Next unzip the compressed file by right clicking on it and selecting <i><b>Extract All...</b></i>

Then, you may delete the original zipped file if you wish, and open the decompressed folder.

Lastly, double click the <b>dynamic-shortcuts.exe</b> file in the folder (this step is to be repeated everytime you wish to run the app directly).
